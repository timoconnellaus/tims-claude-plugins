## Screen Reader Support

Ink has basic support for screen readers.

To enable it, you can either pass the `isScreenReaderEnabled` option to the `render` function or set the `INK_SCREEN_READER` environment variable to `true`.

Ink implements a small subset of functionality from the [ARIA specification](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA).

```jsx
render(<MyApp />, {isScreenReaderEnabled: true});
```

When screen reader support is enabled, Ink will try its best to generate a screen-reader-friendly output.

For example, for this code:

```jsx
<Box aria-role="checkbox" aria-state={{checked: true}}>
	<Text>Accept terms and conditions</Text>
</Box>
```

Ink will generate the following output for screen readers:

```
(checked) checkbox: Accept terms and conditions
```

You can also provide a custom label for screen readers if you want to render something different for them.

For example, if you are building a progress bar, you can use `aria-label` to provide a more descriptive label for screen readers.

```jsx
<Box>
	<Box width="50%" height={1} backgroundColor="green" />
	<Text aria-label="Progress: 50%">50%</Text>
</Box>
```

In the example above, the screen reader will read "Progress: 50%" instead of "50%".

##### aria-role

Type: `string`

The role of the element.

Supported values:
- `button`
- `checkbox`
- `radio`
- `radiogroup`
- `list`
- `listitem`
- `menu`
- `menuitem`
- `progressbar`
- `tab`
- `tablist`
- `timer`
- `toolbar`
- `table`

##### aria-state

Type: `object`

The state of the element.

Supported values:
- `checked` (boolean)
- `disabled` (boolean)
- `expanded` (boolean)
- `selected` (boolean)

### General Principles

- **Provide screen reader-friendly output:** Use the `useIsScreenReaderEnabled` hook to detect if a screen reader is active. You can then render more descriptive output for screen reader users.
- **Leverage ARIA props:** For components that have a specific role (e.g., a checkbox or button), use the `aria-role`, `aria-state`, and `aria-label` props on `<Box>` and `<Text>` to provide semantic meaning to screen readers.

For a practical example of building an accessible component, see the [ARIA example](/examples/aria/aria.tsx).
