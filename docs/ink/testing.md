## Testing

Ink components are simple to test with [ink-testing-library](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink-testing-library).
Here's a simple example that checks how component is rendered:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import {Text} from 'ink';
import {render} from 'ink-testing-library';

const Test = () => <Text>Hello World</Text>;
const {lastFrame} = render(<Test />);

lastFrame() === 'Hello World'; //=> true
```
