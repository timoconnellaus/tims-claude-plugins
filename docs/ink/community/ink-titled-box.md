## Props

### borderStyle

This is the same as that in Ink, except it is required.

### titles

An array of titles for the border.

### titleStyles

The styles of titles as shown in [Title Styles](#title-styles). Without styles,
the titles have a transparent background and padded on both ends with a space.
The value is an object with the following properties:

- `start`: the character before the title. 
- `end`: the character after the title.

The library provides some title styles through the export `titleStyles`. You can
create your own in addition to those. You can use the provided styles as
follows:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import {TitledBox, titleStyles} from "@mishieck/ink-titled-box";

const Demo: React.FC = () => (
    <TitledBox
        borderStyle="single"
        titles={["Demo"]}
        titleStyles={titleStyles.rectangle}
    />
);
```

> Note: apart from `titleStyles.rectangle`, all other styles use 
> [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com). So, if you do not have Nerd Fonts
> installed, you will not get the expected results.
