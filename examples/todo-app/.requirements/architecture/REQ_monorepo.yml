  Scenario: Monorepo structure
  Given the project structure
  When organizing code
  Then all packages should be in a Bun monorepo
  And shared tooling is used
  And consistent versioning is maintained

priority: medium
aiAssessment:
  sufficient: true
  notes: Test verifies Bun monorepo by checking for root package.json with
    workspaces array. Currently failing as expected since monorepo not yet
    configured.
