  Scenario: Uncomplete a todo
    Given a todo store with a completed todo
    When a user marks the todo as incomplete
    Then the todo is marked as not completed
    And the completion timestamp is cleared

  Scenario: Uncomplete already incomplete todo
    Given a todo that is already incomplete
    When a user marks it as incomplete again
    Then the operation is idempotent (no error)
